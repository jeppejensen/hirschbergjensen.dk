<h1>We&#8217;re getting married</h1>

<h2>and we would like to share this special day with you!</h2>

<h3>The wedding ceremony and celebration will take place in Copenhagen, the city where we met each other. We look forward to seeing our family and friends joined in this city, hopefully all of you can make it!</h3>

<h3>Tips for travelling</h3>
<p>For those of you who need to come by plane, we can recommend momondo.com to find the cheapest ones. 
Copenhagen airport is only a 15min train or metro ride away from the city centre, if you get off at the main station or at Norreport you should be able to change to a metro or bus that take you to your accomodation, maybe you can even walk from there.
As an alternative to Hotel- search webpages you might want to have a look at air bnb, a webpage where rooms in or entire private apartments can be rented. Anyplace in the centre should be ok to reach the venues, vesterbro, frederiksberg or the centre are very nice areas to stay.</p>

<h3>Directions to the venues</h3>
<p>The ceremony will be held at St. Petri Kirke the German church in the centre of Copenhagen. 
Address
The church is in walking distance from the big Metro station Norreport and also from the main station, both of which can be reached by various trains, buses or the metro. For those who come by car.. parking&hellip;.</p>

<p>Dinner and Party will take place at Cafe Elefanten on the area of the old Carlsberg brewery. 
Address
It is a 20min walk away from the main station, only 10 min away from the train stop enghavevej (Line ..) and even closer to the bus stops&hellip; Once you are on the brewery area you can follow the signs towards the Cafe.
By car&hellip; parking&hellip;</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Children and babies are more than welcome at our wedding &ndash; Oskar would like to have lots of friends to play with. In case the children need some rest or sleep there will be a separate and quiet room for them.</p>
